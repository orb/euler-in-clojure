;; Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n-1)/2. The
;; first ten pentagonal numbers are:

;; 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

;; It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their
;; difference, 70 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

;; Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum
;; and difference is pentagonal and D = |Pk - Pj| is minimised; what is
;; the value of D?

;; this solution takes about a minute on my laptop using the improved mathematical
;; pentagonal? test. It takes this long because I actually exchaustively search
;; the solution space.  Many solutions to this problem only search the first 2500 or
;; so pentagonal numbers, which is enough time to find a solution but not enough time
;; to know that the solution is minimal. 

;; For example, at p(2500), the difference between p(2501) and p(2500) is well under
;; 10000 which is couple orders of magnitude higher than the answer.  There's no
;; justification for stopping the search the low except that the answer is accepted
;; by the website - so move on.

;; How hi do we have to search?  The first answer is found by the time you get to
;; the 2168th value.  However, my code searches all the way up to p(1827555) at
;; which time p(1827555) - p(1827554) exceeds the best known difference.  Short
;; of mathematical proof that it cannot be that p(1827555) and p(1827554) can't
;; be a solution, it's wrong to stop the search orders of magnitude earlier.  The
;; good news here is that once you get so high, the number of prior pentagonal
;; numbers that could be part of the solution becomes very small and the search becomes
;; very, very fast
